Initial Thoughts
================

.. _Initial Thoughts:

Main Interface
--------------

This software has the capability to be very powerful. However, the
software is laid out in a rather unintuitive manner. The UI somehow
looks like a worse version of ANSYS SpaceClaim, there are so many
sub-windows covering the screen that the software becomes borderline
unusable, and the viewport navigation is downright atrocious.

UPSIDES
-------

It isn't all bad, though. There are several upsides to the program, one
of which is that everything is contained within the main program. No need
to bounce around between Workbench, Fluent, Mesher, etc. etc.
